# gXPlanet Setup
#
First, you will need the latest PHP4 if you want to install this, with iconv module compiled, and, thats all :).

#
# Install
#
Copy this package into your folder, it should be public_html.

First, look at the examples/ folder, you will find some examples to put work gXPlanet, in every folder you can see a "index.php" file, copy on of them into your root folder, look this example:

	$ cd examples/default/
	$ cp index.php ../../

You can make your own "index.php" file, try to read the others to make your own for your site.

Now put the right permissions to your cache/ folder:

	$ chmod 777 cache/

We need this to write the RSS files.

#
# Configure
#
Go to include/ folder, then edit config.php to put work right gXPlanet, then edit people.php if you want add more people to our planet.

If you copy the index.php file from the examples/default/ folder, choose the right stylesheet from it, in the config.php do this, choose a "style", per default, "default".

If you want generate your own style, copy de default/ folder to styles/my_style, edit the index.php and thats all for this time i guess :).
